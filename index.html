            <div id="title_description">Hello to all of your Survivor fans and future Survivor players, do you imagine 
                 that one day in your life, you'll have a chance to play <bold>Survivor</bold>.
                 Then, you finally get the call to be on Survivor and get out there and believe
                 that you had the preparation for the show. You've seen the dynamics of the game,
                 you've seen the challenges, you studied all of the other players strategies, you
                 might think that you won't have any trouble playing the game. But there does come
                 a time when you might need to get rid of this player because he or she is a threat
                 to your game, but you also might need them to stick around if they're the only one
                 who really knows how to fix the shelter, start the fire, or catch fish properly and
                 that could lead to you making a bad decision to keep them in the game that could 
                 backfire on you. Well that won't happen if I explain to you how you can do all of
                 those Survivor camp activities. That way you can get rid of that player without ever
                 figuring out how to do that specific camp activity yourself after you get rid of them.         
            </div>
    <!--Paragraph that introduces you to the links to the other webpages.-->
            <div id="link_showcase">
                On this website, there are a couple of pages that will show you how to do these 
                Survivor camp activities properly. That way you will be able to adapt to the 
                environment of Survivor without happening to relay on your biggest threat in the 
                game to do it.
